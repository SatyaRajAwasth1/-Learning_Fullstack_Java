        // Defined as automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding object wrapper classes. For example, converting an int to an Integer, a double to a Double, and so on.
        //unboxing ---> If the conversion goes the other way, this is called unboxing.
        //thats Automatically converting an object of a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive type is known as unboxing. For example â€“ conversion of Integer to int, Long to long, Double to double etc.
